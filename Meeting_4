Meeting with Ryan, Kevin R, and Simon. Talked about working on the Node.JS for the bookmarks page and meeting at 12 in the engineering center on Monday.
Decided to reduce scope and not implement a calander and to-do list. 
Login page ejs has been tested with the login database. posting users to it and getting users from it both work.
Database will be modified to have a seperate table for hyperlinks.
Ryan will work on milestone 5 and have it completed by the duedate on sunday.
